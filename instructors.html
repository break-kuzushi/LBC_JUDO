          <h2>Instructor 1: Masahiko Kimura</h2>
          <p>
            Masahiko Kimura was a Japanese judoka and professional wrestler. He
            is often considered one of the greatest judoka of all time. He was
            born on September 10, 1917, in Kumamoto, Japan. Kimura began
            training Judo at the age of 9 and by the age of 15, he had achieved
            the rank of 2nd dan. He became a 5th dan at the age of 18, which was
            an impressive feat as it usually takes many years of study and
            practice to achieve this rank. Kimura was known for his intense and
            rigorous training regimen, which included thousands of push-ups and
            hundreds of throws every single day. He won the All Japan
            Championship at the age of 20 and went on to win it for three
            consecutive years. Kimura passed away in 1993. His legacy lives on
            in the martial arts world, and the Kimura, a reverse ude-garami arm
            lock, is named after him.

          <h2>Instructor 2: Kyuzo Mifune</h2>
          <p>
            Kyuzo Mifune was a Japanese judoka who is considered one of the
            greatest judoka of the 20th century. He was born on April 21, 1883,
            in Iwate Prefecture, Japan. Mifune started practicing Judo at the
            age of 13 and joined the Kodokan at the age of 22. He quickly rose
            through the ranks, achieving the rank of 7th dan at the age of 30.
            Mifune was known for his technical prowess and his philosophy of
            'the flexibility of mind and body.' He was also known for his
            excellent teaching skills and contributed significantly to the
            development of Judo through his writings and teachings. Mifune
            passed away in 1965. His contributions to Judo are still recognized
            today, and he is often referred to as the 'God of Judo.'

          <h2>Instructor 3: Shiro Saigo</h2>
          <p>
            Shiro Saigo was one of the earliest disciples of Judo. He was born
            on February 4, 1866, in Aizu Wakamatsu, Japan. Saigo, together with
            Tsunejiro Tomita, became the first in the history of judo to be
            awarded Shodan by the founder of judo Jigoro Kano, who established
            the kyu-dan ranking system. He was one of the Kodokan Shitenn≈ç or
            Four Guardians of the Kodokan along with Yoshitsugu Yamashita,
            Sakujiro Yokoyama, and Tsunejiro Tomita. He was known for his
            extreme agility and was nicknamed 'Cat' due to his skill to land on
            his feet when thrown. He developed a personal technique called 'yama
            arashi.'
