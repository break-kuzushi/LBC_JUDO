      <h2>K. Imankulova</h2>
      <p>
        I wish I could give this place 10 stars. A beautiful, clean, and
        spacious facility. Convenient class times in mornings, afternoons,
        evenings. Most importantly, the instructors are world-class, extremely
        talented and truly care about the students. They have a deep knowledge
        of their art, and take the time to patiently teach the smallest details.
        You will feel welcome here regardless of your experience level with
        martial arts. Come try out — you will learn a lot.

      <p>
        This is home, the most welcoming martial arts gym I’ve ever been too.
        Try a class with Gary or Shintaro and you’ll always come back I promise.

        Kano is great. Garry is very welcoming and trains his students to throw
        correctly and aggressively, while reminding them to take care of their
        partners. If you're looking for a friendly, bright, sunny (when the suns
        out), clean place to practice Judo, look no further.
